COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

For this project the requirements were to come up with two models. I chose to work with Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.

Logistic Regression turned out to be better model with HyperTuning compare to Random Forest model. Random Forest model gives little more accuracy however, the run time is very long compare to Logistic Regression Model. The run time for Random Forest model is 2-4 hours compare to Logistic Regression is 30 to 60 min. Difference in accuracy is nominal compare to the amount of time required to run the code. For this reason Logistic Regression model is a better choice.
